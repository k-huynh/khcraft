# KHCraft
KHCraft is a papermc plugin used by JJJ to change the progression system of vanilla Minecraft. Don't judge the name plz I couldn't come up with a better one ðŸ™‚

# Status
### Broken ðŸ’” maybe 40-45% done? 
<br>

## Still to-do (in no particular order)
- implement auto-enchanting tools in inventory based on userenchantments
- implement method to select enchantments (owned)
- implement method to upgrade enchantments on level up (if available)
- change loot tables
- disable villager trading
- custom items (resource pack)
- commands for economy
    - /trade @to amount 'msg'
    - /shop (lists server store items?)
    - /buy itemName
    - /givekb @to amount 'msg' (server operator only)
- commands for skills
    - /skills (lists all skills, exp, levels)
    - /mining upgrade (?)
    - /mining select (?)
- custom achievements

## Doing
- database/config schema for enchantments (link to skill, level requirements)
- populate enchantments table
- give general skill points on (vanilla) level up

- getting exp from chopping
- getting exp from digging
- getting exp from farming
