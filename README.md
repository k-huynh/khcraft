# KHCraft
KHCraft is a papermc plugin used by JJJ to change the progression system of vanilla Minecraft. Don't judge the name plz I couldn't come up with a better one ðŸ™‚

# Status
### Broken ðŸ’” maybe 45% done? 
<br>

## Still to-do (in no particular order)
- implement auto-enchanting tools in inventory based on userenchantments
- implement method to select enchantments (owned)
- implement method to upgrade enchantments on level up (if available)
- change loot tables
- disable villager trading
- custom items (resource pack)
- commands for economy
    - /trade @to amount 'msg'
    - /shop (lists server store items?)
    - /buy itemName
    - /givekb @to amount 'msg' (server operator only)
- commands for skills
    - /skills (lists all skills, exp, levels)
    - /mining upgrade (?)
    - /mining select (?)
    - /givesp @to skillName n (server operator only) (award skill points)
- custom achievements
- cap repair costs for elytra/tridents in anvil

## Doing
- database/config schema for enchantments (link to skill, level requirements)
- populate enchantments table

## Tested as working
- allow creative flight when holding item in off-hand
- adding 'unsafe' enchantments to items
- tested general exp (lvl 29 --> 30 --> 0) = +1 available skill point
- tested mining exp (lvl 0 --> 1 --> 2 --> 3) recognised level up, (lvl 4 --> 5) = +1 available skill point
- tested chopping exp (lvl 0 --> 1) recognised level up, (lvl 4 --> 5) = +1 available skill point
- tested digging exp (lvl 0 --> 1) recognised level up, (lvl 4 --> 5) = +1 available skill point
- tested farming exp (lvl 0 --> 1) recognised level up, (lvl 4 --> 5) = +1 available skill point
- tested combat exp (lvl 0 --> 1) recognised level up, (lvl 4 --> 5) = +1 available skill point
- tested fishing exp (lvl 0 --> 1) recognised level up, (lvl 4 --> 5) = +1 available skill point
- tested archery exp (lvl 0 --> 1) recognised level up, (lvl 4 --> 5) = +1 available skill point
- tested trident exp (lvl 0 --> 1) recognised level up, (lvl 4 --> 5) = +1 available skill point

## Fully Completed
- getting exp from mining
- getting exp from chopping
- getting exp from digging
- getting exp from farming
- getting exp from fishing
- getting exp from combat
- getting exp from trident usage
- getting exp from archery
- custom skillExpEvent calling and listening
- give general skill points on (vanilla) level up

## Future tasks if I can be bothered
- GUI for 'server store'
- GUI for player stores
- GUI for selecting skills
- GUI for choosing new enchantments

# Notes
- did not do any further testing for exp level up events
- POTENTIAL ISSUE: due to floating point operations, there may be inaccuracies with calculating level up bounds. Most of these should be within +/- 1 exp event but i haven't tested nor verified the logic to be 100% correct. Worst case scenarios: not recognising level up resulting in missed skill point awards, or doubly recognising a level up resulting in double skill point awards
